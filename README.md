# 100 Days of Cloud – AWS

## Overview

This repository documents my journey of completing the **100 Days of Cloud (AWS)** challenge.

The goal of this challenge is simple:

> Build real-world AWS solutions consistently for 100 days and strengthen practical cloud engineering skills through hands-on implementation.

I have successfully completed the first **50 days**, focusing on practical implementation of core AWS services, cloud networking, security, automation, and infrastructure as code.

---

## Objective

- Strengthen AWS fundamentals through practical execution
- Gain deeper understanding of cloud networking & security architecture
- Design and deploy production-like infrastructure setups
- Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Improve debugging and troubleshooting capabilities
- Build architecture thinking rather than just service knowledge

---

## Key Implementations

Real-world style implementations completed during this journey:

- Enabling internet access for EC2 in private subnet using NAT Gateway
- Connecting EC2-hosted application to a private RDS instance
- Hosting static websites using S3
- Implementing priority-based message processing using SQS + SNS + Lambda
- Automating infrastructure deployment using CloudFormation templates
- Designing secure VPC architectures with proper isolation

---

## Architecture Thinking

Throughout this journey, emphasis was placed on:

- Security-first design
- High availability principles
- Public/Private resource isolation
- IAM role-based access control
- Infrastructure reproducibility
- Real-world troubleshooting approach

---

## Learning Outcome

After 50 days of consistent hands-on practice, I have:

- Built multiple end-to-end AWS environments
- Strengthened networking fundamentals (VPC, routing, NAT, SG, NACL)
- Practiced infrastructure automation
- Improved debugging in real AWS environments
- Developed stronger cloud architecture foundations

## Why This Challenge?

Consistency builds mastery.

This repository represents discipline, hands-on experimentation, structured learning, and practical cloud engineering experience — not just theoretical understanding.
